# An ATM has banknotes of nominal values 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 dollars. You can consider that there is a large enough supply of each of these banknotes.
# You have to write the ATM's function that determines the minimal number of banknotes needed to honor a withdrawal of n dollars, with 1 <= n <= 1500.
# Return that number, or -1 if it is impossible.
